All members are most welcome. Be sure to introduce yourself in the Layer5<a href=\"https://slack.layer5.io\"> slack </a>and let other community members get acquainted with you and vice-versa.</p>\n\n            <h4>Q: What if I can’t find an open issue to work on?</h4>\n            <p>A: Check if any assigned issues are stale.

On occasion, these one-off meetings are scheduled in advance and put onto the community calendar, while other other times they are simply self-organized by interested contributors. Often contributors will use Slack huddles or Zoom meetings to facilitate the discussion.
