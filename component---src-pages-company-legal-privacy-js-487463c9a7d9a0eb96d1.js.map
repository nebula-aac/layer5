Layer5 must establish a formal, documented process for managing received at the designated <a href=\"mailto:privacy@layer5.io\">privacy@layer5.io</a> email address.\n              </p>\n              <ol>\n                <li><strong>Request Logging:</strong> Creating a centralized log to track the date of each request, the identity of the requester, the nature of the request, the deadline for response (30 days), and the date of fulfillment.</li>\n                <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> Implementing a secure procedure to verify the identity of the individual making the request to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data.</li>\n                <li><strong>Data Discovery and Compilation:</strong> Developing clear workflows for locating and gathering all relevant personal data for a specific individual across all of Layer5's systems.
